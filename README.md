# ReformatFilesApp
TLDR; Tool to fix file names / extensions. 

Sometimes when I download files or attachments from emails, etc. the file extensions are capitalized. e.g. file.TXT. If I try to process or upload these files I get error messages and must manually rename the file extension to lowercase. This is annoying.

So I wrote this tool to automatically rename the files for me, especially handy when operating on mulitple files

Program logic can support multiple functions, and I plan on extending this utility.
 - Uppercase or lowercase file extension
 - Uppercase or lowercase file name
 - Change file name
 - Change file type
 - Do any of the above on any number of files in one batch

To Do
 - <s>Menu to choose which operation to perform on the file(s)</s>
 - <s>Allow user to specify a path / folder (rather than it being hard coded)</s>
 - <s>Error checking</s>

Update

I realize that the extra functionality I am developing really causes more issues than it solves. 
Why would you need to mass convert a bunch of files from png to jpg?
What is more likely to happen is a user is going to use the tool to accidently destroy their data.
Try to change text files into pictures
etc. 

I am going to leave the program as it is for the time being. Program is fully functional, will lowercase file ext. or rename png <--> jpg, and operate on a valid folder path specified by the user or create a default folder for the user to put files into. Program does exactly what it was designed to do so unless I find another use case, this is its final iteration.
